This repo is the implementation of "AI4Reading: Chinese Audiobook Interpretation System Based on Multi-Agent Collaboration".

## Introduction

our contributions are as follows:

- (1) We are the first to study how to automatically construct an audiobook interpretation system AI4Reading using large language models and speech synthesis technology. Compared to manual interpretation, this method is not only time- and labor-efficient but also overcomes language barriers, enabling the interpretation of books from different languages into the target language. In terms of system capabilities, our approach provides interpretations of both Chinese books and Chinese interpretations of English books.

- (2) For the generation of interpretation manuscripts, we propose a multi-agent collaboration approach. To produce engaging interpretative content, this method considers multiple processes, including topic proposal, case extraction, argumentation, expansion, content verification, conversational paraphrasing, and content integration.

- (3) We conducted a manual analysis comparing expert interpretations with our results from two aspects: synthesized speech and interpretation manuscripts. The analysis results show that our method produces interpretation manuscripts that are simpler and more accurate. However, the naturalness and appeal of the generated speech are slightly inferior.
